					<span class="text-primary text-lg">
						This project is built with a strong foundation of modern UI practices and open-source technologies. All
						components are crafted using
						<a href="https://spartan.ng/" target="_blank" class="font-semibold underline">Spartan UI</a>
						and
						<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" class="font-semibold underline">Tailwind CSS</a>
						, allowing for a clean, responsive, and highly customizable interface.

						Spartan UI is a headless, accessible component library for Angular. It provides a robust foundation of
						unstyled and composable UI primitives that let you build your own design system or integrate seamlessly with
						utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. In this project, Spartan UI was used to create reusable
						components such as buttons, dialogs, menus, and formsâ€”ensuring both accessibility and flexibility across the
						application.

					<span class="text-primary text-lg">
						The design and visual direction of this project were heavily inspired by
						<a href="https://originui.com/" target="_blank" class="font-semibold underline">Origin UI</a>
						. Some component designs were directly influenced by their aesthetic and UX patterns, which helped shape the
						look and feel of this application.
