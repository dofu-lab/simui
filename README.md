# Sim UI

**Beautiful Angular UI components built with Tailwind CSS and Spartan.**

A curated collection of ready-to-use components to quickly build modern application UIs.

**Demo: [https://simui.dev](https://simui.dev)**

## Getting Started

Sim UI is built on top of Spartan UI, but the components are designed to work seamlessly with any Angular application. Following a consistent component architecture, Sim UI will feel familiar to Angular developers while providing the visual polish of Tailwind CSS.

**Set up Spartan UI**

You can follow this documentation to setup Spartan UI in your project: [https://spartan.ng/documentation/installation](https://spartan.ng/documentation/installation)

**Prerequisites**

- Angular 19+
- Tailwind CSS 4.x

## Tailwind v4 support

Sim UI is built with Tailwind CSS v4, while maintaining backward compatibility with Tailwind v3 for most components.
